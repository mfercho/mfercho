- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mfercho.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in IT, old electronics like vacuum tubes equipment, measuring devices etc. and I like playing games. :)  
- In programming, I especially like technologies such as .NET with C#, because I have more experience in it than in other programming languages or technologies.
In my life I dealt with: (more or less in this order)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, databases (SQL, MS Access, MS SQL Server), C / C ++, Arduino, React and C#.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying and learning how to be good programmer, or something like that. :P
